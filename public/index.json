Having gone through some Scheme / Racket, some Elm as well as a little Standard ML, I guess I have no more excuse to procrastinate learning Haskell, which was the initial idea all along, basically. I am a little put off but all the horror stories about people who attempted to learn Haskell, unsuccessfully, many times over. So this series of posts will be my way to hold myself accountable and, if so be it, publicly acknowledge my shameful failure and my addition to the above mentioned heap of wannabee Haskellers. Right now I am quite unsure about whether I should go. One route is to just go through the Haskell book as many seem to be suggesting. Another, more project-based and maybe more suited to me, would be to follow this. I think a mix of the two approaches might be the best thing, but then I’d probably get lost - as usual - by doing more than one thing at a time. To add to my confusion, there is (this)[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF1Z-APd9zK7usPMx3LGMZEHrECUGodd3] resource…. I don’t know.

Milan Culture Mapp is a webapp I built when I was collaborating with the Municipality of Milano on a project mapping the city’s cultural venues.
