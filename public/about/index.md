# About me

## TLDR

I am Bernardino,  and I am a **JOATMON** (Jack Of All Trades, Master of None) from Milan, Italy. I built this site mostly as a personal blog to document my journey as a self-taught 50+ computer programmer. Trained as a philosopher, I work as a management consultant.


## Computer stuff

When it comes to computers my main areas of interest lie in AI (I am, by the way, a Google [Certified Tensorflow Developer](https://developers.google.com/certification/directory/tensorflow?hl=it)) and functional programming.

I am on the Advisory Board of [deepers.ai](https://www.deepers.ai), an AI education/consulting platform, and in my extra-time I lead the Italian chapter of [Omdena](https://omdena.com), a platform that helps crowdsource ML/AI products for NGOs, impact and ESG projects.

I occasionally write about artificial intelligence and computer science, e.g.:

- [How to build a neural network from zero](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/building-a-neural-network-from-scratch-8f03c5c50adc) is, well, pretty self-explanatory
- [Want to get good at recursion?](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-one-thing-you-need-to-learn-lecursion-55c03637b5e1) Here is my advice (basically a review of the wonderful _The Little Schemer_ book).

## Personal and varia

I have a beloved son who is currently a student at Bocconi University and I am married with lovely Stephanie. Stephanie and I adopted a Maremma / Retriever Mix named Jonny in 2021 and are very, very, fond of him.
I am a voracious music lover, an avid book reader, and a not very good guitar player.
