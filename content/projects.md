# Projects

Here is some stuff I have been fooling around with.

- [Milan Culture Mapp](https://culturemapp.sassoli.io) is a webapp I built when I was collaborating with the Municipality of Milano on a project mapping the city's cultural venues. THe backend is built in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), the frontend is vanilla JS and the interactive map is rendered in [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/index.html).
- [ReviewGeek](https://reviewgeek.streamlit.app) is a small project I did in a weekend for an acquaintance of mine who signaled they wanted a better way to keep track of TripAdvisor  reviews for their restaurants. It is built in [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).
- A bare bones [calculator](https://calculator.sassoli.io) I built as a [React](https://react.dev) exercise.
