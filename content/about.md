# About me

I am Bernardino, and I am a **JOATMON** (Jack Of All Trades, Master of None) from Milan, Italy. Trained as a philosopher, I work as a management consultant. I am:

- insatiably curious
- unhealthily restless, and
- a voracious learner.

I occasionally write about artificial intelligence and computer science.
