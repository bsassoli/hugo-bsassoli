My notes for [Start the UX design process](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/home/week/1) the second course in [Google's UX Design Professional Certificate on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design?).

## Week 2

- **User stories** (also user **cases** or **scenarios**): one sentence story told from perspective of a user persona (hero, goal, conflict):
  > As a *...*, I want to *...*, so that *...*.
- Remember to consider **edge cases**.

  - start with a *goal*
  - define *actions* to reach that goal
  - for each action describe:
    - tasks
    - feelings
    - improvementd
- Always consider *accessibility* and assistive technology and strive for *curb cut effects*.

## Week 3

- **Problem statement**: a clear statement of a user's problem that needs to be addressed.
  - A good problem statement does:
    - Establish goals
    - Understand constraints
    - Define deliverables
    - Establish benchmarks for success
  > [User name] is a [user characteristics] who needs [user needs] because [insight].
  - *Connect* problem statement with pain points using the **5W and H** framework
  - formulate **hypothesis statements**.
- **Value proposition**:
  - What does our product do?
  - Why should the user care?
  - Process: list product features --> categorize --> connect with user pain points --> revisit

    - viable
- **Competitive audits**:
  1. Outline goals
  2. Create spreadsheet (aim for 5-10 *direct* or *indirect* competitors)
