As far as I can tell, being fairly new to Hugo and all this, if I want to upload a new post I need to:

- do ```hugo new posts/title.md```
- write the post
- do a commit
- push to Github

which seems _a lot_ of unneccessary workflow as well as something I couldn't do from my iPad or mobile device. So: wouldn't it be nice to have something like a plugin for Obsidian or Typora or Notion that takes care of all that?

But, is that even possible given that the source is acutally local?
