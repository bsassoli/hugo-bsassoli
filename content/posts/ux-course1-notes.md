My notes for [Foundation of User Experience Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-user-experience-design/home/week/1) the first course in [Google's UX Design Professional Certificate on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design?).

- [Don Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman) (1998): first idea of UX --> [*The Design of Everyday Things*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things)
- UX => how a person feels about interacting with a product
  - usability
  - equity
  - enjoyability
  - usefulness
- Think of all potential users
- Design + structure + purpose (e.g. ketchup bottle evolution)
- Research from McKinsey shows that value of UX across industries -> increased likelihood of product being shared or recommended
- No similar shared background for UX designers: rather, curiosity, empathy sense of visuals.
- *Three* main types of UX designers:
  - interaction designer
  - visual designer
  - motion designer
- Very often cross-functional teams: UX researchers, UX writers, engineers, PMs, ...
- **Product development lifecycle**:

- Types of designers: generalist, specialist, T-shaped.
- **User-centered design**:

    Understand --> Specify --> Design --> Evaluate --> Understand

{{% admonition question "Doubt!" false %}}
    Very unclear to me what's the real difference between user-centered design and design thinking.

- Assistive technology (examples):
  - color modification(e.g. contrast)
  - voice control
  - screen readers
  - alt text
- Important to pay attention to:
  - users who are new to tech
  - design for low-end devices
  - low access to bandwidth / data (design for offline)
  - scarce computer literacy
- **Design thinking**:
  {{< mermaid >}}
        flowchart LR;
        Empathize --> Define --> Ideate --> Prototype --> Test --> Empathize
    {{</ mermaid >}}
- Other (?) frameworks:
  - user-first
  - inclusive
  - equitable (<mark>what's the difference/definition for the latter two?</mark>)
- **Platform** design principles:
  - *Web*: responsiveness
  - *Mobile*:
    - action-buttons front and center
    - minimize visual clutter
    - both vertical and horizontal layouts
    - keep navigation menus minimal
    - resort to familiar gestures
{{% admonition tip "time spent on platforms!" false %}}
    For a typical interaction, average time on web is 72 secs vs 150 secs on mobile device.
